- ZebraWare.R

- IntegrationWare.R contains functions used to make and QC the objects
    * makeSeuratObjectsFrom10X makes basic objects, collects basic QC
    informationand saves unintegrated objects in unintegrated/
    * plotTradeoffs looks at the results of choosing different count
    cutoffs and mt cutoffs.  Saves the results in integrationFigures/
    * performQC imposes nFeature and mt cutoffs and saves results in
    unintegrated/ with the tag _qc
    * makeLarvalObject merges the 2dpf and 3dpf objects, normalizes
    and runs basic analyses and saves the result in
    intermedieate/larval.rds 

- CopyWare.R contains code to transfer information from old objects
  into new by uniformizing orig.ident and giving each cell a tag
  consisting of its barcode and orig.ident
    * copyCellTypeIntoNewLarval This does what the name says and saves
    the result in intermediate/larval_CellType.rds

- makeLarvalQCFigures.R makes UMAPs of the old and new larval data
  showing orig.ident and CellType and saves these in larvalQCFigures/

- listLarvalCellTypes.R makes tables for the old and new larval
  objects showing the name and count of each CellType
